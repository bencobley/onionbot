    """
    Controls the robot movement.

    This class controls the robots movement by controlling the two Parallax Feedback 360Â° 
    High-Speed Servos `360_data_sheet`_ . The robots local coordinate system is defined in
    the following way. X-axis positive is straight forward, y-axis positive is perpendicular 
    to the x-axis in the direction to the left wheel. The center (0/0) is where the middle
    of the robots chassi is cutting across a imaginary line through both wheels/servos.
    Angle phi is the displacement of the local coordinate system to the real world 
    coordinate system. See :ref:`Used_local_coordinate_system` for a picture of it.

    .. warning::
        Be carefull with setting the min and max pulsewidth! Test carefully ``min_pw`` and ``max_pw``
        before setting them. Wrong values can damage the servo, see set_servo_pulsewidth_ !!!

    :param pigpio.pi pi: 
        Instance of a pigpio.pi() object.

    :param diameter_wheels:
        Diameter of both wheels. 
        **Default:** 66 mm, measured and taken from the products website `wheel_robot`_ .

        This value should not be changed.
        **Default:** 360
    :param float dcMin_l:

        see :ref:`Examples` .
    :param float dcMax_r:
        Max duty cycle of the left wheel. 
        **Default:** 978.25,  measured with method :meth:`lib_para_360_servo.calibrate_pwm` , 
        see :ref:`Examples` .
    :param int l_wheel_gpio:
        GPIO identified by their Broadcom number, see elinux.org_ .
        To this GPIO the feedback wire of the left servo has to be connected.
    :param int r_wheel_gpio:
        GPIO identified by their Broadcom number, see elinux.org_ .
        To this GPIO the feedback wire of the right servo has to be connected.
    :param int servo_l_gpio:
        GPIO identified by their Broadcom number, see elinux.org_ .
        To this GPIO the control wire of the left servo has to be connected.
    :param int min_pw_l:
        Min pulsewidth, see **Warning**, carefully test the value before!
        **Default:** 1280, taken from the data sheet `360_data_sheet`_ .
    :param int max_pw_l:
        Max pulsewidth, see **Warning**, carefully test the value before!
        **Default:** 1720, taken from the data sheet `360_data_sheet`_ .
    :param int min_speed_l:
        Min speed which the servo is able to move. **Default:** -1, so that

        the inner control loop.
    :param int max_speed_l:
        Max speed which the servo is able to move. **Default:** 1, so that 
        the speed range is also scaled between -1 and 1 as the output of 
        the inner control loop. 
    :param int servo_r_gpio:
        GPIO identified by their Broadcom number, see elinux.org_ .
        To this GPIO the control wire of the right servo has to be connected.
    :param int min_pw_r:
        Min pulsewidth, see **Warning**, carefully test the value before!
        **Default:** 1280, taken from the data sheet `360_data_sheet`_ .
    :param int max_pw_r:
        Max pulsewidth, see **Warning**, carefully test the value before!
        **Default:** 1720, taken from the data sheet `360_data_sheet`_ .
    :param int min_speed_r:
        Min speed which the servo is able to move. **Default:** -1, so that

        the inner control loop. 
    :param int max_speed_r:
        Max speed which the servo is able to move. **Default:** 1, so that 
        the speed range is also scaled between -1 and 1 as the output of 
        the inner control loop. 
    :param float sampling_time:
        Sampling time of the four PID controllers in seconds.
        **Default:** 0.01.
        1. PWM of motor feedback is 910Hz (0,001098901 s), so position changes cannot 
        be recognized faster than 1.1 ms. Therefore, it is not needed to run the outer control 
        loop more often and update the speed values which have a 50 Hz (20ms) PWM.
        2. Tests of the runtime of the code including the controller part have shown that
        writing the pulsewidth (pi.set_servo_pulsewidth()) in :meth:`lib_para_360_servo.write_pwm.set_pw` is 
        the bottleneck which drastically slows down the code by the factor ~400 
        (0,002 seconds vs 0,000005 seconds; runtime with vs without writing pulsewidth).
        3. For recognizing the RPMs of the wheels 10ms is needed to have enough changes in the
        position. This was found out by testing. See method :meth:`move` for more informations.
    :param int,float Kp_p:
        Kp value of the outer PID controllers, see method :meth:`move` 
        for more informations.
        **Default:** 0.1.
    :param int,float Ki_p:
        Ki value of the outer PID controllers, see method :meth:`move` 
        for more informations.
        **Default:** 0.1.
    :param int,float Kd_p:
        Kd value of the outer PID controllers, see method :meth:`move` 
        for more informations.
        **Default:** 0.
    :param int,float Kp_s:
        Kp value of the inner PID controllers, see method :meth:`move` 
        for more informations.
        **Default:** 0.5.
    :param int,float Ki_s:
        Ki value of the inner PID controllers, see method :meth:`move` 
        for more informations.
        **Default:** 0.
    :param int,float Kd_s:
        Kd value of the inner PID controllers, see method :meth:`move` 
        for more informations.
        **Default:** 0.
